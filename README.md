# WannaBe
Just a small wannabe - ransomware written in Python for sandboxing

# # Description

Nothing much to describe - first you have to run the tcpServer.py script and then the encryptor-to-server.py. It will encrypt the test2.txt file and then creates a file called 'lizard.txt'
with the key for decrypting the file. It will send it to the tcpServer.py script you are running simulteneously.

# # Things to Do
